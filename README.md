This GitHub repository features a diverse collection of projects, highlighting my contributions to sports analytics and environmental conservation through data science. A standout project is my participation in the NFL Big Data Bowl 2024, where I pioneered the Tackle Opportunity Window (TOW) metric. Leveraging TOW, along with other detailed metrics provided by the NFL on a frame-by-frame basis, I developed a neural network model that predicts the likelihood of a defensive player making a tackle. This metric evaluates the effectiveness of defensive players in making tackles by considering their physical and tactical skills. It has been well-received in the analytics community and earned recognition in the Kaggle competition.

Additionally, I am currently spearheading a project aimed at giving detailed insight into our planet's greenhouse gas emissions. This project encompasses the collection of data via NOAA's API using a custom-developed algorithm, followed by a rigorous process of cleaning, transforming, and loading the data into an AWS database. Subsequently, I will undertake exploratory data analysis and feature engineering to finely tune the data for a specially designed deep neural network built from scratch aimed at forecasting emission trends. The goal is to create a Streamlit dashboard that clearly presents emissions data from the past, present, and future to provide environmental insights to all as there are plenty of sources on the web for getting raw data on greenhouse gas emissions, but hardly any visualizations that provide insight into past, present, and future trends. This project will be done and published within the next 2-3 months.

The "Tackle Opportunity Window" (TOW) project introduces a metric to measure the effectiveness of NFL defensive players in executing tackles, focusing on the critical moments before a tackle. By calculating the dynamic Euclidean Distance across successive frames, TOW quantifies the time a defender remains within a specific proximity to the ball carrier, thus reflecting their ability to track, accelerate, and strategically position themselves. Data preprocessing involved synthesizing a binary classification 'tackle', leveraging over 12 million data entries, and ensuring unique identifiers for each play through normalization and transformation techniques. A deep neural network, incorporating player orientation and direction, was developed to predict tackling outcomes. This approach acknowledges the split-second decisions that influence NFL play dynamics.

The project highlights the importance of tactical positioning and orientation alongside physical attributes for successful defense. The TOW metric offers a novel perspective in evaluating defensive performance, emphasizing the synthesis of physical prowess and tactical intelligence. Overall, this innovative study provides valuable and tangible insights into the intricate balance required for effective defensive play in the NFL.
